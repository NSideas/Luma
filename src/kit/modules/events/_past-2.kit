      <p>We visited the First Tee of Cleveland to learn about The Patty Wood Girls Leadership Academy, a unique program for girls age 12 â€“ 14. The PWGLA mentors (past participants) shared how the program has helped them stand up and speak up as leaders. Then we joined the young leaders for yoga!</p>
